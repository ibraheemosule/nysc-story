                    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

                    <p>My name is Ibrahim Sule, a 24 year old recent Graduate of the University of Lagos from the department of petroleum and Gas Engineering.</p>
                    <p>Staying at home after my completion of my academic program was a fancied experience as everyday seems to be filled with events of same routines. As I anxiously waited for the news of deployment, the days seemed farther and sometimes
                        i couldnt help but think nysc would be canceled during my set. Then it happened, finally, I was deployed to Okada camp in Edo State on the 27<sup>th</sup> of March, 2019. Out of extreme eagerness to obey the clarion call, i packed
                        my load and started my journey to Okada camp (little did i know of what awaits me).</p>
                    <p>With no previous travelling record to Edo state, the journey was something I really looked forward to. It was approximately 5hrs journey from Lagos when travelling by car, the joy of having to finally leave my house after months of
                        inactivity filled my heart. The trip was smooth and stress free, but what baffled me the most was the vast amount of land in Nigeria, If we had put all the land to good use, it would have been very beneficial to our development.</p>

            <h3 id="camp">CAMP</h3>

            <p>The camp was more exciting than I thought it would be, there were a lot of people and the initial registration process was very rowdy. It dawned on me that I had to hustle to get anything from bed, to chairs, to even the kits that we were
                going to use. However, coming from Lagos I was already accustomed to such and was able to get all that was necessary. Being the only son, I had no one to tell me about how to efficiently survive, hints about the things to watch out for
                or the things to plan for, so I was essentially involved in almost all activities. The second day started pretty bad, upon hearing the continuous sound of the beagles by 04:30 AM from the Soldiers, I was shocked, quickly, I stood up thinking
                something bad had happened. My bunkmate took his bucket to fetch water, I asked him if it was time to wake up, he laughed and said "it's time to bath". With my sleepy eyes, I borrowed bucket, queued at the bathroom door, got my bath and
                hurried back so that I could get another sleep, little did I know that we had to get to the parade ground immediately and this was just the beginning of a hectic day. We had our training session, prepared for the oaths swearing and the
                other processions. All these activities were a bit strange, since I had no one to tell me beforehand. As time went on, I already got used to the daily routine, ensuring I knew how to get my way around all activities and met new colleagues
                that share the same view about the whole NYSC scheme.</p>

            <h3 id="post_camp">POST CAMP</h3>
            <p>As the whole camp was coming to an end, it started to get emotional because everyone will now go their different ways, I couldn't hide how painful that felt but that's how life is. The prayer of those who would be staying in the state was
                to get posted to the capital, mine answered, I was posted to a secondary school in the capital city. Upon discovering my PPA, I returned to lagos, prepared myself and went back to Benin.
            </p>
            <h3 id="ppa">PLACE OF PRIMARY ASSIGNMENT</h3>
            <p> I was posted to the capital, but I wasn't impressed with the area where the school was, it was literally a village. The secondary school had a large land mass with very few students. After they confessed to me they had no Mathematics teacher,
                I knew there was a problem after all, mathematics teachers are usually the back bone of a school. I took the new role upon myself to be the new Mathematics teacher which would later turn out to be a bad decision.</p>
            <p>There are a lot of advantages being in a village setting, some of which are cheap food, nice neighbors, less rush, Natural view and peace. The village had hills, and water bodies were I could play, it was like beautiful, only that the people
                living there had some dirty habits which made it less fun. My first day of school wasn't one to write home about, the students weren't encouraging to say the least, some of them couldn't read and write in secondary school let alone solve
                Mathematics. I was dealing with village children with very poor backgrounds. At first, I was being aggressive at them, but after some time I changed my style since it's not their fault they are the way they are. I taught them the basics
                first before going into their syllabus. The Principal wanted me to go on with the scheme of work, but I felt there are some things they need to grasp knowledge of before diving into the syllabus, this I believe, was for their own good.
                I had a slight misunderstanding with the Principal due to this issue, but we later came to terms.

            <h3 id="cds">COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SERVICE</h3>
            <p>The Community Development Service is an activity that I enjoyed the most, it's a very important and play a vital part in the scheme of NYSC, we to meet every Thursday to discuss intuitively about issues concerning the state. Since I was in
                SDG (Sustainable development Goals), we had 17 goals to choose from, and a lot to talk about. The monthly sensitization was usually the most exciting, were we went as group to different locations to give talks and donate items as a group.
                I almost didn't miss any CDS meeting because I knew I stood to gain something very useful.</p>
            <h3 id="lifestyle">LIFESTYLE</h3>
            <p>I lived an introverted lifestyle during my stay in Edo State, possibly because of the stories I've heard in the past about the rate of cultism and hooliganism lifestyle. The only social activity i engaged in was football. This was when i gravitated
                into programming and its been a wonderful experience so far. Attached below is a copy of my resume.
